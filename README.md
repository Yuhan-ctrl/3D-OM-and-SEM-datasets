# 3D-OM-and-SEM-datasets
This repository provides original data (3D datasets, correlative datasets) and demonstrative correlative analysis for the manuscript entitled 'Serial sectioning SEM for 3D reconstruction and correlative characterisation of graphene nanocomposites' authored by Yuhan Li and Milo Shaffer. Please feel free to use the datasets for modeling, image analysis, or other relevant material studies.
