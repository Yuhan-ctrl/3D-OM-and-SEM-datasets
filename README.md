# 3D-OM-and-SEM-datasets
This repository provides original data (3D datasets, correlative datasets) and demonstrative correlative analysis for the manuscript entitled 'Serial sectioning SEM for 3D reconstruction and correlative characterisation of graphene nanocomposites' authored by Yuhan Li and Milo Shaffer. Please feel free to use the datasets for modeling, image analysis, or other relevant material studies. 

For each type of the nanocomposites, a 'File format and instructions.rtf' is available, which provides information on the contents in each folder, the relevant pixel information,and how to use the files. A 'Correlative analysis example' is provided for Elicarb graphene epoxy nanocomposites, demonstrating the correlative analysis described in the paper.

| Folder | Description |
| ---------- |-------------|
| OM images sections            | Optical microscopic images of nanocomposite sections                                 |
| OM maps                       | Optical concentration maps of nancomposite sections                                  |
| SEM images                    | SEM images of nanocomposite sections at different magnifications                     |
| Correlative analysis example  | Containing OM ans SEM datasets, landmark analysis, and demonstrative images or videos|
